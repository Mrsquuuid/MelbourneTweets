The boundaries for this dataset follow the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).<br/><br/>\n\nThe Australian Department of Education, Skills and Employment publishes a range of labour market data on its <a href=\"http://lmip.gov.au\" target=\"_blank\">Labour Market Information Portal</a>. The data provided includes unemployment rate, employment rate, participation rate, youth unemployment rate, unemployment duration, population by age group and employment by industry and occupation.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n AURIN has spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://lmip.gov.au/default.aspx?LMIP/Downloads/ABSLabourForceRegion\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>. Data Source: ABS Labour Force Survey, 12 month average, December 2020. The ABS advises that analysis of regional labour force estimates should typically be based on annual averages, which are important for understanding the state of the labour market and providing medium and long-term signals. The application of annual averages, however, is unlikely to accurately or quickly detect turning points in the regional data during periods of significant change (such as during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic).
